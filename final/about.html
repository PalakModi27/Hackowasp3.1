        This website is the initiative by our team to help those in need and pain to fight this deadly disease
        of novel coronavirus. We focus on the health and well being of those who are isolated at home as there
        are some with no help around. We will try to give them proper prescriptions after getting their symptoms
        from their end. This website aims to maintain their daily record of symptoms, SpO2 level and
        temperature, warn them if they need a doctor or medical help and to give them time to time reminder to
        check their SpO2 levels and body temperature.
