<p>This website is the initiative by our team to help those in need and pain to fight this deadly disease of novel coronavirus. We focus on the health and well being of those who are isolated at home as there are some with no help around. We will try to give them proper prescriptions after getting their symptoms from their end. We will also focus on what other diseases they are having and will make sure to provide better treatment in those conditions also. This website aims to maintain their daily record of symptoms, SpO2 level and temperature, warn them if they need a doctor or medical help and to give them time to time reminder to check their SpO2 levels and body temperature.
